      <h2 className="about__subtitle">Who HelpEat ?</h2>
      <p className="about__paragraph">
        Sacha and Dana Marciano are just your average, slightly sleep-deprived
        young parents with a newborn and, let’s be real, very little patience
        for meal prep. They’re definitely not aiming to revolutionize the
        cooking world or create the next viral recipe app. They just want to
        grab a snack without thinking twice. This app is actually Sacha’s final
        project for his SE course, and Dana, who’s got an eye for style, came up
        with the concept and design—because sometimes dreams are just about
        getting a little more time to sleep.
