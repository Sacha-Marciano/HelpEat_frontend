## Technical Description

The app uses the third-party API FreeMeal. On each call, the API returns a recipe with an image, ingredients and steps to reproduce.
The user can save recipes as it's favorite and add a eat schedule.
Based on the ingredients of the meals in the eat schedule, HelpEat will generate a personalized grocery list.
